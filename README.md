# Module 7 Challenge - Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Overview

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The application should have: 

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates how the application functionality should work:
